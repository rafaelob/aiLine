# Progress Analysis Reference

## Mastery Level Definitions

| Level | Description | Indicator |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Mastered | Consistent, independent performance | 85%+ on 2+ assessments |
| Proficient | Adequate performance with minor gaps | 65-84% on recent assessments |
| Developing | Significant gaps requiring support | Below 65% or inconsistent |

## Intervention Strategy Matrix

| Gap Type | Signs | Intervention | Duration |
|----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Conceptual | Can't explain "why" | Reteach with concrete → pictorial → abstract | 3-5 sessions |
| Procedural | Knows "why" but errors in "how" | Guided practice with immediate feedback | 2-3 sessions |
| Fluency | Correct but slow | Timed practice, games, drill | Ongoing |
| Application | Can do isolated but not in context | Problem-based learning, real-world tasks | 3-5 sessions |
| Motivation | Can do but won't | Choice, relevance, social learning | Ongoing |

## Trend Analysis Criteria

- **Improving**: 2+ consecutive data points showing upward movement
- **Stable**: Data points within 5% variance
- **Declining**: 2+ consecutive data points showing downward movement
- **Volatile**: Large swings (>15%) between consecutive data points — may indicate inconsistent effort, test anxiety, or accommodation issues

## Risk Thresholds

| Risk Level | Criteria | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Low | 0-1 developing standards, stable/improving | Monitor |
| Medium | 2 developing standards OR 1 declining trend | Targeted intervention |
| High | 3+ developing OR multiple declining OR very low engagement | Intensive support + specialist referral consideration |

## Grouping Best Practices

- Maximum 5-6 students per small group
- Groups should be flexible (reassess every 2-3 weeks)
- Mix ability levels for collaborative work
- Same-level groups for targeted reteaching
- Consider accessibility needs when forming groups (e.g., hearing + sign language together)

## Report Communication Templates

### For Teachers
- Lead with strengths, then gaps
- Provide specific, actionable next steps
- Include time estimates for interventions
- Reference curriculum standards

### For Parents/Guardians
- Use accessible, non-technical language
- Focus on growth and progress, not just scores
- Suggest home support strategies
- Avoid jargon; explain mastery levels in plain terms
