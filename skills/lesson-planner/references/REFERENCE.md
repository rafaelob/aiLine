# Lesson Planning Reference

## Lesson Plan Quality Criteria

### Alignment Check
Every lesson plan must have clear alignment:
- Objective → Activity → Assessment (OAA alignment)
- Each objective has at least one activity AND one assessment
- Bloom's taxonomy level matches across all three

### Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

| Level | Verbs | Activity Types |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| Remember | list, define, identify, recall | Flashcards, matching, fill-in |
| Understand | explain, describe, summarize, classify | Graphic organizers, paraphrasing |
| Apply | use, solve, demonstrate, implement | Practice problems, simulations |
| Analyze | compare, contrast, examine, differentiate | Case studies, Venn diagrams |
| Evaluate | judge, critique, assess, justify | Debates, peer review, rubric-based |
| Create | design, construct, produce, compose | Projects, presentations, original work |

## Time Allocation Guidelines

| Grade Level | Direct Instruction | Guided Practice | Independent | Closure |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| K-2 (EF I) | 5-8 min | 10-12 min | 8-10 min | 5 min |
| 3-5 (EF I) | 8-12 min | 12-15 min | 10-15 min | 5-8 min |
| 6-8 (EF II) | 10-15 min | 15-20 min | 15-20 min | 5-10 min |
| 9-12 (EM) | 15-20 min | 15-20 min | 20-25 min | 5-10 min |

## Engagement Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Time |
|----------|------------|------|
| Think-Pair-Share | Processing new information | 3-5 min |
| Exit Ticket | End of lesson assessment | 3-5 min |
| Gallery Walk | Sharing multiple products | 10-15 min |
| Jigsaw | Complex content division | 20-30 min |
| Socratic Seminar | Deep discussion | 20-30 min |
| Quick Write | Activating prior knowledge | 3-5 min |
| Turn and Talk | Brief partner discussion | 2-3 min |

## BNCC Quick Reference Structure

Format: `EFxxYYzz` where:
- `EF` = Ensino Fundamental
- `xx` = grade/year (01-09)
- `YY` = subject (LP=Lingua Portuguesa, MA=Matematica, CI=Ciencias, etc.)
- `zz` = skill number

Example: `EF05MA07` = 5th grade, Math, skill 07
