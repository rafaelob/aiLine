# Socratic Tutoring Reference

## Socratic Method Framework

### Question Types (Progressive)

| Level | Type | Purpose | Example |
|-------|------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Diagnostic | Assess current understanding | "What do you already know about X?" |
| 2 | Clarifying | Ensure student can articulate | "Can you explain that in your own words?" |
| 3 | Probing | Deepen thinking | "Why do you think that happens?" |
| 4 | Perspective | Consider alternatives | "What would happen if...?" |
| 5 | Consequence | Explore implications | "If that's true, then what else must be true?" |
| 6 | Meta | Reflect on learning | "How did you figure that out?" |

### Hint Ladder

When a student is stuck, provide hints in this order:
1. **Redirect**: "Think about what we discussed about [related concept]"
2. **Narrow**: "Focus on [specific part of the problem]"
3. **Scaffold**: "What's the first step you need to do?"
4. **Partial reveal**: "The answer involves [category/approach]"
5. **Worked parallel**: "Here's a similar, simpler example: [...]"
6. **Direct help**: Only after all above fail, provide explicit guidance

### Response Patterns

| Student Behavior | Tutor Response |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Correct answer | Validate + ask "how" or "why" |
| Partially correct | Acknowledge correct part + probe incorrect |
| Incorrect | Don't say "wrong"; ask them to check/verify |
| "I don't know" | Break into smaller questions |
| Frustrated | Validate feelings + offer easier entry point |
| Off-topic | Gently redirect + connect to topic |

## Feedback Best Practices

### Do
- Be specific: "Your calculation of area is correct"
- Be immediate: provide feedback right after the attempt
- Be encouraging: "Good thinking! Now consider..."
- Focus on the process, not just the answer
- Use student's own words when possible

### Don't
- Say "that's wrong" without explanation
- Give away the full answer too early
- Use sarcasm or condescension
- Compare to other students
- Ignore incorrect reasoning (even if answer is right)

## Adaptive Difficulty

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Student answers 3+ correctly | Increase complexity |
| Student struggles 2+ times | Decrease complexity, add scaffolding |
| Student answers quickly | Add "why" questions to deepen |
| Student takes long but correct | Maintain level, build fluency |
| Student shows frustration | Switch approach, validate effort |

## Accessibility Adaptations for Tutoring

| Need | Adaptation |
|------|-----------|
| TEA | Predictable question format, explicit instructions |
| TDAH | Shorter exchanges, frequent checkpoints |
| Learning | Simpler vocabulary, visual supports |
| Hearing | Text-based interaction, visual examples |
| Visual | Descriptive text, audio-friendly format |
