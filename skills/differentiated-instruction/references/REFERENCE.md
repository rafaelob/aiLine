# Differentiated Instruction Reference

## UDL Framework (CAST)

### Principle 1: Multiple Means of Engagement (WHY)

| Guideline | Strategies |
|-----------|-----------|
| Recruiting interest | Choice, relevance, authenticity, reduce threats |
| Sustaining effort | Goals, challenge levels, collaboration, mastery feedback |
| Self-regulation | Expectations, coping skills, self-assessment, reflection |

### Principle 2: Multiple Means of Representation (WHAT)

| Guideline | Strategies |
|-----------|-----------|
| Perception | Alternatives for visual/auditory info, customizable display |
| Language & symbols | Vocabulary support, multiple media, cross-linguistic |
| Comprehension | Background knowledge, patterns, transfer, generalization |

### Principle 3: Multiple Means of Action & Expression (HOW)

| Guideline | Strategies |
|-----------|-----------|
| Physical action | Vary response methods, assistive technology |
| Expression & communication | Multiple media for expression, multiple tools |
| Executive functions | Goal setting, planning, strategy development, progress monitoring |

## Tiering Strategies

### By Content (what students learn)
- Same topic, different complexity of texts/sources
- Same concepts, different depth of exploration
- Same essential question, different entry points

### By Process (how students learn)
- Same activity, different scaffolding levels
- Same exploration, different structure/support
- Same inquiry, different pacing/grouping

### By Product (how students show learning)
- Same standards, different assessment formats
- Same rubric criteria, different product types
- Same quality expectations, different complexity

## Grouping Configurations

| Type | When to Use | Duration |
|------|------------|----------|
| Readiness groups | Skill-specific practice | 1-2 weeks, then reassess |
| Interest groups | Project-based, inquiry | Project duration |
| Mixed-ability groups | Collaborative tasks, peer teaching | Varies |
| Student choice | Independent practice, assessment | Per task |
| Whole class | Direct instruction, shared experiences | As needed |

## Choice Board Template (3x3)

| Visual-Spatial | Verbal-Linguistic | Logical-Mathematical |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Draw/diagram | Write paragraph | Create chart/graph |
| Create poster | Record podcast | Solve problem set |
| Build model | Debate/discuss | Design experiment |

## Scaffolding Progression

1. **Heavy scaffold**: Graphic organizer, word bank, worked example, sentence starters
2. **Moderate scaffold**: Reference sheet, partial model, guiding questions
3. **Light scaffold**: Checklist, peer review protocol, self-assessment rubric
4. **Independent**: Open-ended prompt with success criteria only

Goal: Move students from heavy → independent over time.
